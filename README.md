# Hey, I'm Akash 👋  
*Turning ideas into code and dreams into apps.*

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a **curious builder**, lifelong **student**, and someone who feels most alive when creating something meaningful with code. Whether it’s designing a clean UI, solving a tricky backend bug, or figuring out how tech can actually *help* people — I’m in.  

Right now, I’m learning, experimenting, and laying the groundwork for what I hope will be my future **startup**.

## 🚀 Tech I Enjoy
- **Comfort Zone:** JavaScript, React, Next.js, Express, Python, Tailwind, HTML/CSS  
- **Always Exploring:** Full-stack workflows, authentication systems, and scalable design  
- **Love Learning:** Anything that pushes me to grow as a creator and problem solver  

## 🌟 Projects I’m Proud Of
- **FlashGenix** *(private)* — Smart AI-powered flashcard + quiz tool to boost how we learn and retain info. Built it to scratch my own itch.  
- **Passnova** *(private)* — A sleek take on user authentication and secure logins. Because security shouldn't be scary.

> ⚡ I don’t just build for fun — I build because I care about the *why* behind things.

## 🔧 What I’m Working On Now
- Taking deeper dives into web app frameworks  
- Building tools that are both useful and beautiful  
- Exploring open source and sharing what I learn  

## ✨ A Few More Things About Me
- ♟️ Chess addict — challenge me and I’ll bring my A-game  
- 📖 Bookworm — from fiction to full-stack dev guides  
- 🛐 When stuck, I code harder... and pray smarter
